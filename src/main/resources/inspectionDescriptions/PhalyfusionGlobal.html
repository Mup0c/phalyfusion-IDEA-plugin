<p>Reports static code problems detected by analysers combined by Phalyfusion via Phalyfusion executable file</p>
<p>
    The inspection requires Phalyfusion to be properly installed and set up in the IDE under Settings/Preferences | Languages & Frameworks | PHP | Quality Tools | Phalyfusion.
    It is recommended to install Phalyfusion as a Composer dependency.
    <br>
    Phalyfusion needs to be configured fully via phalyfusion.neon. Analysers used by Phalyfusion must be configured properly either.
    <br>
    This inspection will run Phalyfusion as ./phalyfusion analyse ANALYSED_FILE. So make sure that all analysers used by Phalyfusion configured properly to run analysis on separate files of your project.
